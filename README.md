# Can Quantum computers break RSA encryptionÂ ?
----------------------------------------------

The repository contains an implementation of the RSA algorithm as well as an implementation aimed at cracking it. This implementation was inspired by a video on the Veritasium channel :).
<br />
Please note that the cracking algorithm is designed to demonstrate the difficulty of breaking RSA encryption and is only effective for small numbers, showcasing the time and effort required for such an endeavor. In addition to that, understanding the process of cracking RSA will help understanding why quantum computers are useful.
